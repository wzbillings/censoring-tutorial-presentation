# Introduction to Censored Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Learning outcomes for this presentation:

1.  Define censored data, including left, right, and interval censored
    data.
2.  Adjust the likelihood function of a parametric model to account for
    deterministic censoring.
3.  Implement maximum likelihood methods for censored outcomes, like HAI
    titer using an optimizer and using the `survival` package.
4.  Ratios of censored values (e.g.Â titer increase outcomes).
5.  Implement bayesian methods for censored outcomes, like HAI titer,
    using Stan or `brms`.
6.  Implement bayesian joint modeling methods for censored predictors,
    like norovirus HBGA titer for infection outcome in the bivalent
    study using Stan.
