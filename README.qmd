# Introduction to Censored Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Learning outcomes for this presentation:

1. Define censored data, including left, right, and interval censored data.
1. Adjust the likelihood function of a parametric model to account for
deterministic censoring.
1. Implement maximum likelihood methods for censored outcomes, like HAI titer
using an optimizer and using the `survival` package.
1. Ratios of censored values (e.g. titer increase outcomes).
1. Implement bayesian methods for censored outcomes, like HAI titer, using Stan
or `brms`.
1. Implement bayesian joint modeling methods for censored predictors, like
norovirus HBGA titer for infection outcome in the bivalent study using Stan.
